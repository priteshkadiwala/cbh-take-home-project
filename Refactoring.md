# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

The refactored code improves readability by simplifying the conditional logic and removing unnecessary variable assignments. Early returns are used to exit the function as soon as the result can be determined. By using object destructuring, we extract the partitionKey property directly, making the code more concise. The variable names are chosen to be descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each variable.

The refactored code achieves the same functionality as the original code while improving readability through simpler and more straightforward logic.
